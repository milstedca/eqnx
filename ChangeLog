	* doc/pic.ms: Document `PY` macro, new to groff 1.23.0.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?64575>.

2023-08-22  Dave Kemper <saint.snit@gmail.com>

	* tmac/pic.tmac (PY): Call `PF` rather than duplicating its
	{three bytes of} code.  This is almost too trivial to DRY, but
	{1} the new form is a cue to the human reader that .PY is meant
	to be an alias of .PF; and {2} .PE was already defined as a
	variant of .PF with an explicit call to it, so this makes the
	.PY definition conform to that precedent.

	* tmac/an.tmac: Stop setting `an*can-hyperlink` if formatting
	for PDF; we don't yet have support for this implemented, leading
	to vanishing text when the `U` register is true and, for
	instance, `UR`/`UE` are called with no link text.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?64572>.

	* src/devices/grops/ps.cpp (ps_printer::define_encoding):
	* src/devices/grops/psrm.cpp (resource_manager::output_prolog)
	(resource_manager::supply_resource): Report more intelligible
	diagnostics when libgroff's `font::open_file()` returns a null
	pointer without setting `errno`.  The only way this can happen
	is if it rejected the file name for containing a slash, thus
	attempting directory traversal (recall Savannah #61424).  Also
	fix code style nits: explicitly `#include` errno.h C standard
	library header, align style of null pointer checks, and stop
	explicitly setting `errno` to zero before (indirectly) calling
	`fopen()`; we inspect `errno`'s value only under a documented
	error condition (a null stream pointer).  See errno(3).

	* NEWS: Add item; we should have mentioned this (and produced
	these better diagnostics) when 1.23.0 was released.
	Distributors may find this change desirable to backport.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?64577>.  Thanks to Phil
	Chadwick for the report and Deri James for swiftly finding a
	correct workaround that suited the reporter.

	* configure.ac: Include paper format in configuration report.

	* m4/groff.m4 (GROFF_PAGE): Slightly refactor, and help users to
	figure out how the "configure" script decided upon the paper
	format it did by supplementing the `AC_MSG_RESULT` message.  If
	not falling back to the "letter" default or honoring a
	command-line setting (e.g., "./configure PAGE=a4"), report which
	file or command was used to infer the paper locale.  Apply DRY
	principle by using shell variables more.

	Prompted by discussion with Damian McGuckin on the groff list.

	[man]: Add new `TS` register to configure required separation
	between a (`IP`, `TP`) paragraph's tag and its body, and change
	the default amount used for this purpose from 1n to 2n.  Retire
	private register `an-tag-separation` in favor of `TS`.

	corresponds to the amount used by historical man(7) and mdoc(7)
	implementations going back to Unix Version 7 and 4.3BSD-Reno,
	respectively.

	* tmac/an.tmac: Introduce new interface register, `BP`, to

	determined it, the default relative inset amount, and the
	default amount of additional indentation used by `IP`, `TP`, and
	the deprecated `HP`.

	[tbl]: Fix staggering of text block entries.

	* src/preproc/tbl/table.cpp: Add C preprocessor macro storing a
	"text block staggering macro" name.
	(block_entry::position_vertically): Call it in generated output
	with a negative half-vee motion.
	(block_entry::position_vertically, left_block_entry::print)
	(right_block_entry::print, center_block_entry::print)
	(alphabetic_block_entry::print): Call it in generated output
	with a positive half-vee motion.
	(table::init_output): Write out its definition in generated
	output.  It wraps the `sp` request.  If we're in a diversion,
	use the `\!` technique to recursively call ourselves and bubble
	up the spacing request a diversion level (spacing requests of
	anything other than 1v are ignored in diversions).  Otherwise,
	invoke the request.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?64454> a.k.a. Debian

	[man]: Deprecate `SB` macro.  It is a SunOS 4.0 (1988) extension
	that in most contexts, does nothing you can't achieve with `SM`
	and `B` together (in either order).

	Study of the SunOS 4 man page corpus suggests a reason for its
	introduction of this macro: use of `SB` immediately after `TP`
	was common (610 out of 2,111 occurrences).  The problem with
	`TP` and the mechanism suggested above is that input traps in
	troff normally ignore the `\c` escape sequence, the use of which
	would be necessary to get the desired effect.  In groff since
	1.22.4, the man(7) `TP` macro uses GNU troff's `itc` request,
	which _does_ respect `\c`.  (mandoc(1) 1.14.2 and later behave
	compatibly with groff man >= 1.22.4.)  Solaris 11 switched to
	groff as its troff implementation, so there is no reason for
	newly written or currently maintained man pages to employ `SB`.

	* tmac/an.tmac (SB): Throw deprecation warning.

	* tmac/groff_man.7.man.in (Description): Move macro from table
	to deprecation list.
	(Font style macros): Move description from here...
	(Deprecated features): ...to here.
	(Portability): Drop mention, since we don't encourage people to
	use it at all.

	An apparent bug in a support library affects some users; it
	disables gxditview's pop-up menu.  (The menu pops up, but no

	(top_level_diversion::get_next_trap_name): New member function

	[docs]: Revise material in our Texinfo manual.

	* doc/groff.texi (Manipulating Filling and Adjustment): Document
	a CSTR #54 erratum; the arguments to the `ss` request are in
	12ths of the selected font's `spacewidth` parameter, not 36ths
	of an em.  Drop false claim of rounding of `.ss` and `.sss`
	register values on terminal devices.  (Rounding of any resulting
	adjustment quantities might still occur, but this is part of the
	usual application of motion quanta and not particular to the
	`ss` request.)  Characterize "undiscardable space" as
	"horizontal motion" to help the reader acquire this essential
	distinction between horizontal spaces and motions.
	(Manipulating Spacing): Clarify behavior.  Distinguish `sp`
	request from `\v` escape sequence and cross reference the
	latter.  Recast to squeeze presentation of `ss` request onto one
	U.S. letter page when typeset.  Drop (commented-out) trivial
	example of `ls` usage in favor of new example illustrating some
	macros using `vs` instead, for pedagogical purposes and to eat
	up a lot of dead space on the page caused by a later lengthy
	example.  (Knuth-Plass for the...uh...win.)
	(Page Control): Stop (arguably) mis-applying the term "widow",
	in favor of less metaphorical language.  Extend Woolf example to
	narrow the seas of vertical space produced by TeX's formatting
	of the page it occupies.  (Our blanched discourse can use the
	purple prose.)
	(Page Motion): Fix straggling use of "escape" as a noun; we
	prefer "escape sequence".

	Slightly refactor.

	[grodvi, grops, xditview, libbib, libgroff, eqn, pre-grohtml,

	(family_change): Call `is_family_valid()` on given argument.
	If invalid, throw diagnostic and ignore `fam` request.
	* src/roff/troff/env.h (is_family_valid): Declare; make visible.
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (main): Call `is_family_valid()` on
	`-f` option argument.  Its invalidity is a fatal error.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?64155>.  Thanks to Dave
	Kemper for the report.

2023-05-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[tbl]: Refactor handling of type size and vertical spacing.

	* src/preproc/tbl/table.h (struct inc_number): Rename this...
	(struct size_expression): ...to this, and change its member
	types.  The `inc` `short` becomes a `relativity` enum
	because it only ever takes 3 values.  The `val` short becomes an

	already being done for [fFmM].

2023-05-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/preproc/tbl/main.cpp (process_format): Accept (and
	discard) space and tab characters after [pPvV] in a column

	the same loop style as the others, for consistency.

2023-05-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[eqn]: Implement tunable "half_space" and "full_space"
	parameters.  They default to the same widths as "thin_space" and
	"thick_space", respectively, but control the widths of the '^'
	and '~' input tokens.

	* src/preproc/eqn/box.cpp: Add globals `half_space`,
	`full_space`.
	(struct S): Recognize "half_space" and "full_space" as
	parameters to the "set" primitive, and map them to the globals.
	(half_space_box::output): Format the half space width.
	(full_space_box::output): Format the full space width.
	(full_space_box::output, thick_space_box::output): Drop

	[troff]: Fix Savannah #64166.

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (bold_font): Add `WARN_MISSING`
	diagnostic if request given no arguments; it does nothing, and
	the behavior of this request is sufficiently complex that it's
	worth saying so.  Stop throwing font lookup error if second
	argument cannot be resolved as a font name; it might be an
	emboldening amount instead.

2023-05-10  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	operator.

2023-05-07  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Fix Savannah #64104.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (set_escape_char): Rename this...

	control characters.
	* doc/groff.texi (Using Escape Sequences): Document
	restrictions.

	* src/roff/troff/env.h (class environment): Slightly refactor.
	Rename fields `control_char` and `no_break_control_char` to
	`control_character` and `no_break_control_character`,
	respectively, and make them private.  Add public getters and
	setters for them.
	(get_control_character): New public member function returns
	`unsigned char`.
	(set_control_character): New public member function takes an
	`unsigned char` and returns a `bool`.
	(get_no_break_control_character):
	(set_no_break_control_character): Similar.
	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (environment::environment): Update
	constructors to use new field names and initialize them in their
	new order of declaration.
	(environment::copy): Similar.  (Not to be confused with a copy
	constructor, this member function implements the operation of a
	valid `evc` GNU troff request.)
	(environment::get_control_character):
	(environment::set_control_character):
	(environment::get_no_break_control_character):
	(environment::set_no_break_control_character): Implement.

	requests.

	(init_env_requests): Drop `init_request` calls for them.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Resurrect handling of `cc` and `c2`
	requests here, with more error handling.
	(assign_escape_character, process_input_stack): Use the new
	getters defined above in environment object since the relevant
	fields are now private.
	(assign_control_character): New function assumes the former
	responsibilities of env.cpp:control_char and rejects the request
	if the desired character is already the escape or no-break
	control character.
	(assign_no_break_control_character): New function assumes the
	former responsibilities of env.cpp:no_break_control_char and
	rejects the request if the desired character is already the
	escape or control character.
	(process_input_stack): Reorder comparisons to avoid inadvertent
	lvalue assignment.  Add parentheses to assignment with complex
	RHS.
	(init_input_requests): Attach `cc` and `c2` requests to new
	functions above.
	* doc/groff.texi (Control Characters): Document restrictions.

2023-05-07  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Don't quote a character with itself in diagnostics.

2023-05-06  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Revise output warning diagnostic format.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (do_error): For the `OUTPUT_WARNING`
	value of the `error_type` enum, spell out the words "page" and
	"diversion" instead of abbreviating them, and place the
	diversion information (if present) in parentheses.

	[troff]: Drop `POPEN_MISSING` preprocessor macro.

	3 source files test this macro but nothing appears to define it.
	It dates back to (at least) 1994.  I suspect this of being
	bitrot.  Reasons include: (1) We test for a declaration of
	`popen` in our "configure.ac" file; (2) our gxditview command
	uses `popen` _without_ #ifdef-guarding it (perhaps the
	assumption was that any system that supported X11 also had a
	working `popen`); (3) our "nonposix.h" header file defines a
	macro aliasing `popen` to `_popen`, which is its typical name on
	Windows systems, and is the most likely build host candidate for
	which support might have been missing as late as 1994.
	Microsoft end-of-lifed MS-DOS in 2000.  If someone wants to
	start up a FreeDOS port, talk to us.  Maybe even that has a
	functional `popen()`.  Here's hopin'.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp ([global], file_iterator::close)

	[troff]: Make futile aliasing an error.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (alias_macro): Promote diagnostic
	when attempting to alias a nonexistent macro/string/diversion
	from warning to error; this aligns with the handling of the
	requests `chop`, `stringup`, `stringdown`, `substring`,
	`asciify`, `unformat`, and `writem` when they are regarded as

	[tbl]: Fix Savannah #63838.

	* src/preproc/tbl/table.cpp (table::add_entry): Throw error

	[man]: Preserve user-selected font family.

	* tmac/an.tmac: When initializing, save the currently selected
	font family as `an*body-family` instead of forcing 'T' (Times,
	which is the formatter's default, even on nroff-mode devices
	that can't switch families).  This change makes the formatter's
	`-f` option work on man(7) documents again (important for
	Japanese man pages, but there is now once again nothing stopping
	you from viewing man pages in Palatino or Helvetica on the 'ps'
	and 'pdf' devices where these families are available).  It also
	reopens an avenue for rogue pages to affect the rendering of
	unrelated documents later in batch rendering, but there are many
	other, and worse, ways for rogue pages to do damage.  Problem
	introduced by me in commit e0e16d8e65, 15 March 2022.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?64130>.  Thanks to Deri

	* tmac/pdfpic.tmac: Refactor to make comprehensible some
	woefully undocumented cleverness and improve efficiency.
	(PDFPIC): Break out flaming-hoop-leaping "clever" bit of `sy`
	usage into its own macro, calling from here and relocating its
	requests from here...
	(pdfpic@get-image-dimensions): ...to here.  When using `sy`
	request to collect and munge output of pdfinfo(1), (a) disable
	the escape character while defining the macro; (b) construct the
	command in a roff string, appending to it in discrete, hopefully
	comprehensible chunks; (c) disable the escape character during
	macro interpretation wherever possible (most of it); (d) retain
	doubled backslashes so that they survive subsequent string
	interpolation; (e) stop using grep(1) in the pipeline when
	sed(1) is perfectly capable of performing its own input
	filtering; (f) invoke sed with '-n' option and emit output only
	upon a successful substitution; (g) replace unportable(!) POSIX
	BRE character class '[:digit:]' in substitution match text with
	'[0-9]'; and most importantly (h) replace multi-line sed 's'
	replacement text (see below for the reason we can't use it) with
	single roff control line employing the groff extension escape
	sequence `\R` to assign multiple registers.  Annotate
	portability and escaping challenges.  Tested on GNU/Linux, macOS
	12, and (with simulated pdfinfo(1) output) Solaris 11.

	There is a problem with trying to embed true newlines into the
	arguments of a `sy` request.  The C++ function that GNU troff
	uses to assemble the command string (character by character)
	_does not recognize C/C++ string literal escape sequences_.
	This means that you _cannot_ embed "\n" in `sy`'s arguments and
	have it survive, as a newline character, into the command string
	passed to the standard C library's system(3) function.  ("A\nB"
	gets encoded as 'A', '\\', 'n', 'B', not 'A', '\n', 'B'.)
	Unfortunately, this appears to be AT&T troff-compatible
	behavior.  But it means that you _cannot_ portably construct
	multi-line replacement text for sed's 's' command.  (Other sed
	commands like 'a', 'c', and 'i' will be similarly affected.)
	See Savannah #64071.

	* PROBLEMS: Drop item.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?64061>.  Thanks to Bruno
	Haible for the report, and to him and Ralph Corderoy for the

2023-04-03  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[build]: Ship groff.dvi (our Texinfo manual in DVI format).

	* doc/doc.am (install-dvi-local, uninstall-dvi): Add targets.
	(uninstall-local): Depend on "uninstall-dvi".

2023-04-03  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[build]: Resume shipping pic.html.

	* m4/groff.m4 (GROFF_CHECK_GROHTML_PROGRAMS)
	(GROFF_GROHTML_PROGRAM_NOTICE, GROFF_PNMTOOLS_CAN_BE_QUIET):
	Rename "make_htmldoc" to "use_grohtml" as expected by
	"configure.ac".  Also stop `AC_SUBST`ing it; we don't need
	"@use_grohtml@" in our Makefiles since an `AM_CONDITIONAL` in
	configure.ac already does an equivalent thing.  Continues commit
	aa5787c1eb by me from 20 May.
	(PROCESSEDDOCFILES): Drop "$(PROCESSEDDOCFILES_HTML)" from macro
	definition; annotate why.

2023-03-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	m4/groff.m4 (GROFF_TMAC): Eliminate garbage leading space from
	contents of `tmac_wrap` shell variable.

2023-03-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[build]: Clarify output of `GROFF_TMAC` Autoconf test.

	* configure.ac: Correct characterization of the list of macro
	packages reported.  It is not the list of macro packages
	receiving a "g" prefix, but the list of macro packages reciving
	a wrapper macro file in groff's macro directory, each of which
	sources the corresponding system (likely AT&T-descended troff)
	macro package.  Fixes wording I introduced in commit 4d30dd7424,
	31 May.
	* m4/groff.m4 (GROFF_TMAC): Clarify first "checking" message:
	we are looking for a file name prefix on existing system macro
	packages (like "tmac.").  This has nothing to do with the prefix
	applied to groff commands, or the "g" prefixed to groff
	implementations of the man, mm, and ms packages.  Tighten
	wording of second "checking" message.  Consistently say "(none)"
	instead of "none" or "none found".

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?63900>.

2023-03-11  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/doc.am (install-txt): Look for "groff.txt" in the source
	and build directories in sequence; it could be in either place
	depending on whether the build is from the Git repository or
	from a distribution archive.  Annotate this.  Fixes
	"install-doc" target when building from Git repository.  Problem
	introduced by me in commit 691fc70108, 22 February.  Thanks to
	Nikita Ivanov for the report.
	(install-pdf-local, install-html-local): Similar.

	Also fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?64059>, later
	reported anonymously.

2023-03-10  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/doc.am (maintainer-clean-local): Remove temporary "*.t2d"
	and "*.t2p" directories created by texi2dvi.

2023-04-20  Bruno Haible <bruno@clisp.org>

	[build]: Fix gxditview linking on AIX.

	* m4/groff.m4 (GROFF_X11): Add macro dependency on
	`AC_CANONICAL_HOST`.  Introduce new variable `X_AW_DEPS`, empty
	on most hosts.  If we otherwise have Athena widget library
	support, and the host is AIX, force linkage against Xpm and Xext
	libraries to reflect modern Athena dependencies, which AIX's
	linker doesn't figure out on its own.  `AC_SUBST` this variable,
	exposing it to Automake files.
	* src/devices/xditview/xditview.am (gxditview_LDADD): Use it.

	{A similar change might also be useful for HP-UX, another Unix
	System V descendant; see
	<http://hpux.connect.org.uk/hppd/cgi-bin/wwwtar?/hpux/Gnu/\
	groff-1.23.0/groff-1.23.0-src-11.31.tar.gz+groff-1.23.0/\
	HPUX.Install+text>.  --GBR, 2023-07-10}

2023-04-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add "sys_wait" module.  MinGW
	does not provide "sys/wait.h", which we require in
	src/preproc/html/pre-html.cpp since commit 11137209ed, 27 June.

2023-04-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* Makefile.am: Initialize (as empty) Automake variables that we
	don't use but which gnulib modules expect to be defined.
	(AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS, SUBDIRS, noinst_HEADERS, noinst_LTLIBRARIES)
	(pkgdata_DATA, MOSTLYCLEANDIRS, AM_CFLAGS): Do it.

	Thanks to Bruno Haible for the advice.

2023-04-22  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[mdoc]: Regression-test Savannah #57665, but for mdoc.

	* tmac/tests/doc_TS-do-not-keep-tables-when-cR-set.sh: Do it.
	* tmac/tmac.am (tmac_TESTS): Run test.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?64037>.
